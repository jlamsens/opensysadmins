# Password recovery mechanism
The password recovery mechanism on a Cisco 2960 Catalyst switch can be enabled or disabled to balance security needs and administrative accessibility. Hereâ€™s why an organization might choose to enable or disable this feature.

## Enable
- Accidental Lockout Recovery: Administrators may forget passwords or lose access credentials. Enabling password recovery ensures they can regain access without drastic measures like a full device reset, which could result in configuration loss.

- Quick Access Restoration: In critical environments where uptime and quick recovery are essential, being able to quickly recover passwords helps minimize downtime and maintain network operations smoothly.

- Administrative Ease: Simplifies management for environments where many devices are maintained by different administrators who might occasionally need to recover access.

## Disable
- Enhanced Security: Disabling password recovery prevents unauthorized physical access from leading to device compromise. If someone gains physical access to the switch, they cannot simply use the password recovery procedure to break into the system.

- Compliance Requirements: Some industries and regulatory environments require strict controls on access to network devices. Disabling password recovery can help meet these stringent security policies.

- Controlled Access: Ensures that only individuals with proper credentials and authorization can make changes to the network configuration, adding an additional layer of security.
