Cisco hands-on labs are a learning resource provided by Cisco Systems, a well-known networking and IT infrastructure company. These labs are designed to offer practical, real-world experience in working with Cisco networking equipment and technologies. They are particularly valuable for individuals preparing for Cisco certifications, such as Cisco's CCNA (Cisco Certified Network Associate) or CCNP (Cisco Certified Network Professional) exams, as well as for IT professionals who want to gain hands-on experience with Cisco products and solutions.

This tutorial guides you through the relevant steps that are required to initialise and install a physical LAB PC, with a local Clonezilla restore option.
You’ll go from an *empty computer* to to a fully configured *Windows/Linux dual-boot* environment.
