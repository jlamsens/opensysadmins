# Install Windows 11

Note: if you want to dual-boot or multi-boot with Microsoft Windows, it is easier and recommended to install Windows first, before you install Linux Mint.

## Boot from flash drive
Attach the Windows 11 bootable flash drive to your computer using any available USB port.

## Choose boot order
When your computer restarts, BIOS will attempt to boot from the first device in the order you specified. To override this, consult your hardware manual to access the boot menu. In this example, I have to press the ++f12++ key as soon as I see the "Fujitsu" splash screen to show the boot menu.
