# Tutorials landing page.

## What?
Tutorials are lessons that take you, the reader, by the hand through a series of steps to complete a project of some kind. They are learning-oriented.

## Say what?
They are a matter of craft. Skill. It’s knowledge, but it’s practical knowledge, not theoretical. Complex or advanced, basic or well known.

## What they do
They introduce. They educate. They learn.

## Answers the question
"Can you teach me to...?"

## Oriented to
Learning. Let's begin. Let's dive in. With teacher guidance. They serve the need of the user @study. They provide an enjoyable, successful learning experience.

## Purpose
- to allow you, the newcomer, to get started
- to help you, a beginner, achieve basic competence
- to show you, the learner, that you can be successful
- to turn you, new *learner*, into a *user*

## Form
A lesson, *learning how* rather than *learning that*. By providing exercises that are:

- meaningful
- successful
- logical
- usefully complete

## Analogy
Teaching someone how to cook. Enjoy. Gain confidence. Repeat.

## My responsability
It’s not easy being a teacher. I'm responsable for...

- *what* you are to learn
- *what* you will *do* in order to learn it
- your success

## Your responsability
- there is *no* responsibility on you to learn, understand or remember
- *only* follow the instructions as closely as you can
- and be attentive

## Approach
- I'll try not to *teach*
- I'll get you started
- I'll follow a carefully-managed path, starting at a given point and working to a conclusion
- I'll familiarize
- in a contrived setting
- I'll eliminate the unexpected
- and be explicit about basic things
- I'll teach general skills and principles
- by providing the big picture and setting expectations
- and by ensuring results
- I'll make the tutorials repeatable and safe
- describe concrete steps, not abstract steps
- offer minimum explanation
- and ignore options and alternatives

## The problem.
- tutorials are difficult to do well
- and time consuming
- with lots of revisions
- and I, the teacher, am not present
